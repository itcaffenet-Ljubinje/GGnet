# PHASE 0 - CHANGES

## Summary

This phase involved a comprehensive analysis of the current GGnet project state and mapping to ggRock functionality requirements. No code changes were made - this was purely an analysis and planning phase.

## What Was Done

### 1. Repository Inventory
- **File**: `repo_inventory.json`
- **Purpose**: Complete inventory of current project structure
- **Content**: Detailed mapping of all files, modules, and their purposes
- **Key Findings**: Well-structured FastAPI + React application with solid foundations

### 2. Component Mapping
- **File**: `PHASE_0_MAPPING.md`
- **Purpose**: Map current components to ggRock functionality
- **Content**: Detailed analysis of what's complete vs what needs work
- **Key Findings**: 
  - Backend core is complete and well-implemented
  - Frontend is complete and modern
  - Main gaps are in system integration (qemu-img, targetcli, DHCP, TFTP)

### 3. Risk Assessment
- **File**: `PHASE_0_RISKS.md`
- **Purpose**: Identify and categorize risks for the transformation
- **Content**: High/Medium/Low risk categorization with mitigation strategies
- **Key Findings**:
  - High risk: Root privilege requirements and external dependencies
  - Medium risk: Performance and compatibility issues
  - Low risk: Development and deployment concerns

### 4. Assumptions Documentation
- **File**: `PHASE_0_ASSUMPTIONS.md`
- **Purpose**: Document all assumptions about environment, requirements, and constraints
- **Content**: Comprehensive list of technical, operational, and business assumptions
- **Key Findings**: Clear requirements for Debian/Ubuntu, root access, and system dependencies

## Key Discoveries

### ‚úÖ STRENGTHS
1. **Modern Architecture**: FastAPI + React + TypeScript + Pydantic V2
2. **Complete Data Models**: All core entities (User, Machine, Image, Target, Session) implemented
3. **Authentication System**: JWT + Redis session management working
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket implementation for live monitoring
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, edge cases, integration tests all passing
6. **Code Quality**: Pydantic V2 migration complete, proper error handling, structured logging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GAPS IDENTIFIED
1. **Image Conversion**: No background worker for qemu-img integration
2. **iSCSI Automation**: No targetcli wrapper for automated target creation
3. **PXE Boot**: No iPXE script generation or DHCP configuration
4. **Session Orchestration**: Manual target creation vs automated workflow
5. **Infrastructure**: Missing systemd services, nginx config, install scripts

### üî¥ HIGH RISK AREAS
1. **Root Privileges**: targetcli, DHCP, TFTP require root access
2. **External Dependencies**: qemu-img, targetcli may not be available
3. **Network Configuration**: DHCP/TFTP setup can break network

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Priority
1. **Phase 2**: Image Storage & Conversion (HIGH priority)
2. **Phase 3**: iSCSI Target Wrapper (HIGH priority)
3. **Phase 4**: Session Orchestration (MEDIUM priority)
4. **Phase 6**: Infrastructure (MEDIUM priority)

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Stub Adapters**: Create mock implementations for development
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Implement sudo wrapper scripts
3. **Dependency Checks**: Create installation verification scripts
4. **Isolated Testing**: Test in isolated environments first

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Create `refactor/phase-1-backend` branch (already complete)
2. Start Phase 2: Image Storage & Conversion
3. Implement background worker for image conversion
4. Add qemu-img wrapper script

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete diskless boot workflow from upload to desktop
- [ ] Multiple concurrent sessions supported
- [ ] Automated resource management
- [ ] Production-ready deployment scripts

## Files Created

1. `repo_inventory.json` - Complete project inventory
2. `PHASE_0_MAPPING.md` - Component mapping analysis
3. `PHASE_0_RISKS.md` - Risk assessment and mitigation
4. `PHASE_0_ASSUMPTIONS.md` - Assumptions documentation

## No Code Changes

This phase involved only analysis and documentation. No code was modified, ensuring the existing stable codebase remains unchanged.

## Validation

The analysis was validated by:
- Reviewing all existing code files
- Running existing test suite (all tests pass)
- Analyzing current architecture and dependencies
- Mapping to ggRock requirements

## Conclusion

The GGnet project has an excellent foundation for transformation into a ggRock-style diskless system. The main work involves integrating external system tools and creating automated orchestration layers. The existing codebase provides a solid, modern foundation that can support the required functionality with minimal architectural changes.
