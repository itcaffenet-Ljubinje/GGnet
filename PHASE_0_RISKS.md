# PHASE 0 - RISK ASSESSMENT

## Executive Summary

The GGnet project has a solid foundation but faces several technical and operational risks during the ggRock transformation. The main risks center around system-level integrations requiring root privileges and external dependencies.

## Risk Categories

### ðŸ”´ HIGH RISK - System Integration

#### 1. Root Privilege Requirements
**Risk**: targetcli, DHCP, TFTP configuration requires root access
**Impact**: HIGH - Core functionality cannot work without proper privileges
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement privilege escalation wrapper scripts
- Use sudo with specific command whitelist
- Document security implications clearly
- Provide fallback mock adapters for development

#### 2. External System Dependencies
**Risk**: qemu-img, targetcli, isc-dhcp-server may not be available
**Impact**: HIGH - Image conversion and iSCSI targets cannot function
**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive dependency check scripts
- Provide installation automation
- Implement stub adapters for development/testing
- Document minimum system requirements

#### 3. Network Configuration Conflicts
**Risk**: DHCP/TFTP server setup can break existing network configuration
**Impact**: HIGH - Can disrupt network connectivity
**Mitigation**:
- Use isolated network interfaces where possible
- Provide clear rollback procedures
- Test in isolated environments first
- Document network requirements and conflicts

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK - Performance & Compatibility

#### 4. Image Conversion Performance
**Risk**: Large image files (50GB+) may cause timeouts or memory issues
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Poor user experience, potential system instability
**Mitigation**:
- Implement streaming conversion with progress tracking
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Set reasonable timeout limits
- Provide conversion status updates

#### 5. iSCSI Performance Issues
**Risk**: Network storage performance may be inadequate for boot
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Slow boot times, poor user experience
**Mitigation**:
- Optimize iSCSI target configuration
- Use local storage for frequently accessed images
- Implement caching strategies
- Monitor and log performance metrics

#### 6. UEFI/Secure Boot Compatibility
**Risk**: Boot process may fail on some hardware configurations
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Limited hardware compatibility
**Mitigation**:
- Test on multiple hardware configurations
- Provide fallback boot methods
- Document supported hardware
- Implement hardware detection and configuration

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW RISK - Development & Deployment

#### 7. API Breaking Changes
**Risk**: Existing API endpoints may need modification
**Impact**: LOW - Frontend integration issues
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain API versioning
- Implement backward compatibility
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Clear migration documentation

#### 8. Database Schema Changes
**Risk**: Model changes may require data migration
**Impact**: LOW - Data loss or corruption
**Mitigation**:
- Use Alembic for schema migrations
- Backup procedures before changes
- Test migrations on copy of production data
- Rollback procedures documented

## Technical Debt Risks

### 9. Code Quality Maintenance
**Risk**: Rapid development may introduce technical debt
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Long-term maintainability issues
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain existing code quality standards
- Regular code reviews
- Automated testing and linting
- Documentation updates

### 10. Security Vulnerabilities
**Risk**: New system integrations may introduce security holes
**Impact**: HIGH - System compromise
**Mitigation**:
- Security review of all system integrations
- Principle of least privilege
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits

## Operational Risks

### 11. Deployment Complexity
**Risk**: Production deployment may be complex and error-prone
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Deployment failures, downtime
**Mitigation**:
- Automated deployment scripts
- Staging environment testing
- Rollback procedures
- Deployment documentation

### 12. Monitoring and Debugging
**Risk**: System issues may be difficult to diagnose
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Extended downtime, poor user experience
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive logging
- Health check endpoints
- Performance monitoring
- Debug tools and procedures

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Phase-by-Phase Risk Management

#### Phase 3: iSCSI Integration
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Key Risks**: Root privileges, system dependencies
- **Mitigation**:
  - Create privilege escalation scripts
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Test in isolated environment
  - Document security implications

#### Phase 4: Session Orchestration
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Key Risks**: Network configuration, boot compatibility
- **Mitigation**:
  - Test on multiple hardware configurations
  - Provide fallback mechanisms
  - Document network requirements
  - Implement health checks

#### Phase 5: Frontend (âœ… COMPLETE)
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Status**: Already implemented and tested
- **Action**: Minor adjustments for new features

#### Phase 6: Infrastructure
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Key Risks**: Deployment complexity, system configuration
- **Mitigation**:
  - Automated installation scripts
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Staging environment testing
  - Rollback procedures

## Contingency Plans

### Plan A: Full Integration
